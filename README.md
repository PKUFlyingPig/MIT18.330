# 18.330: Introduction to numerical analysis

This is the repository contains all the learning materials for MIT 18.330, you can go to the original website to get the same resources and blank problem set jupyter notebooks.

## Spring 2020

Welcome to 18.330! This is an introductory course on numerical analysis.

We will be using the [Julia language](www.julialang.org). Please follow [these installation instructions](installation.md).

### Slides, notebooks and recordings from lectures

- Slides and notebooks for each lecture are available in the [lectures](lectures) directory.

- Screen recordings of lectures are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ubkqwrqxnukgllc/AAA2cH9r7YQL7WmYVt-bblxta?dl=0)

- Summaries of each lecture are [here](summaries.md)

### Evaluation

- 9 problem sets 
- Final project 

Problem sets will consist of a mixture of theory and coding. They will be submitted and graded online.

The final project will be an exploration of a topic in numerical analysis that we have not covered in class (although at the level of the class), and will include a discussion of the mathematics behind the method, together with your own implementation.

### Learning Julia

- See https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit for information and resources on Julia.

- More learning resources are available at https://julialang.org/learning/

### Windows users

If you use Windows, please download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org)

### Getting the files

To get the files, use `git` from the command line (or from a GUI), as follows

- Clone the repository once with
```
git clone https://github.com/mitmath/18330
```
This will create a new directory called `18330` which contains the blank jupyter notebooks for problemset.

### Syllabus
